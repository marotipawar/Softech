            Software testing is a process of executing a program or application with the intent
            of finding the software bugs. It can also be stated as the process of validating and verifying
            that a software program or application or product: Meets the business and technical
            requirements that guided its design and development.

            </a>
            <p className="indent-8 text-justify mb-4">
            Before going to study what is testing , what are the various types of testing how to
            perform testing we have to think about why the need of testing.
            In old era, market was monopoly. It means that there was no competition in market.
            Very few companies were there. Due to this whatever company produces people have to
            accept it. Basically they focused on product not on the quality of product. But now a day’s lot
            of investors are there they invest lot of money for profit. Due to huge competition investor
            has to focus on quality of product. It means that with zero defects they have to produce the
            product. Let us take an example of NOKIA phone. Due to change of market condition Nokia
            was not ready to change his operating system he stayed on Sembilan operating system but
            market demands for android. Other mobile companies adapted the new version so these
            companies stayed in market competition but Nokia was unable to survive this huge
            competition and finally he just out of the race. So to produce zero defect products Testing is
            important.

            </a>

            <p className="indent-8 text-justify mb-4">
            Software Quality Assurance defines the set of activities ensuring for quality of software
            product. All these are planned actions which are necessary to provide adequate confidence
            that product must be satisfy the quality of product which customer wants.
            Basically SQA contains different parameters like Customer Expectation, Customer
            Requirement, and Cost of Software product. This comes under technical parameters. And
            risk management and timely deliverable comes under non-technical parameter.
            Customer requirement means for what purpose customer want to produce the software.
            Customer expectation means to meet customer expectation privacy and performance is
            needed. Company have to decide cost of that software and what are the various risk will be
            involved along with if something goes wrong then we have to make it correct.
